![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AugustoResende/RaiLightWallet/master/src/img/current_preview.png)

> A `Light Server` for the https://github.com/AugustoResende/RaiLightWallet project.

> Work in progress.

## How this works
`RaiLightWallet` is a wallet alternative (non-official) for [RaiBlocks](http://raiblocks.net).

## Getting Started
Simply clone down this reposity, install dependencies, and get started on your application.

The use of the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager is **strongly** recommended, as opposed to using `npm`.

```bash
# using git clone
git clone https://github.com/AugustoResende/RaiLightWallet.git
cd RaiLightWallet

# install dependencies
yarn
```

### Development Scripts

```bash
# run application in development mode
yarn dev
```

### Donate are VERY welcome:
